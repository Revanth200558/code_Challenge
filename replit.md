# Python Code Editor - Multi-Challenge Cryptography Platform

## Overview

This is a web-based Python coding challenge platform featuring multiple cybersecurity problems. The application provides an interactive coding environment where users can write, test, and validate their Python solutions across 14 different challenges including Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, MAC, DES, AES, RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Digital Signatures, Mobile Security, Intrusion Detection Systems, Malware Analysis (Trojans and Rootkits), and Database Security. The platform features a dashboard-style interface with challenge cards arranged in the exact order specified by the user's requirements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **Code Editor**: CodeMirror 5.65.2 with Python syntax highlighting and material-darker theme
- **UI Components**: Bootstrap components for navigation, panels, and form elements
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Font Awesome icons for enhanced user experience

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Structure**: Simple monolithic architecture with separation of concerns
- **Routing**: Single-page application with API endpoints for code execution
- **Session Management**: Flask's built-in session handling with configurable secret key

## Key Components

### 1. Multi-Challenge System
- **Dashboard Interface**: Challenge cards grid with difficulty-based color coding arranged in user-specified order
- **14 Cybersecurity Challenges**: Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, MAC, DES, AES, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Digital Signatures, Mobile Security, Intrusion Detection, Trojan Analysis, Rootkit Detection, Database Security, Database Encryption
- **Problem Data Structure**: Centralized problem definitions with individual test cases
- **Navigation**: Dashboard → Individual Challenge → Back to Dashboard flow
- **Challenge Progression**: Next/Previous buttons cycle through all 14 challenges in exact user-specified sequence
- **Exact Challenge Order**: 1) Caesar Cipher, 2) Basic Monoalphabetic Cipher, 3) MAC, 4) DES, 5) AES, 6) RSA, 7) Diffie-Hellman, 8) Digital Signatures, 9) Mobile Security, 10) Intrusion Detection, 11) Trojans, 12) Rootkit Hunter, 13) Database Security, 14) Database Encryption

### 2. Professional Code Editor Interface
- **Enhanced UI**: Larger, more professional design with gradient backgrounds
- **Real-time Editing**: CodeMirror integration with Python syntax highlighting
- **Code Execution**: Frontend JavaScript manages code submission to backend
- **Advanced Features**: Error line highlighting, fullscreen mode, keyboard shortcuts

### 3. Code Execution Engine
- **Security**: Isolated code execution using Python's subprocess module
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Line number detection and visual error highlighting
- **Multiple Test Cases**: Individual test cases per challenge with detailed results
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout management for code execution safety

### 4. Modern UI/UX Components
- **Gradient Design**: Professional gradients and shadows throughout interface
- **Larger Elements**: Increased button sizes, font sizes, and spacing for better UX
- **Split Panel Layout**: Enhanced 50/50 problem description and code editor layout
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, transitions, and visual feedback

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Flask serves the main template with problem data
2. **Code Editing**: User interactions handled by CodeMirror in the browser
3. **Code Execution**: JavaScript sends code to Flask backend via AJAX
4. **Processing**: Backend executes code in isolated environment
5. **Results**: JSON response with execution results returned to frontend
6. **Display**: Frontend updates UI with test results and feedback

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework for responsive design
- **CodeMirror 5.65.2**: Code editor with syntax highlighting
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for enhanced UI

### Backend Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework for Python
- **Standard Library**: Uses built-in modules (os, logging, subprocess, tempfile, json)

### Runtime Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Backend runtime environment
- **Modern Web Browser**: Frontend compatibility

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Flask development server with debug mode enabled
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic restart on code changes during development
- **Port Configuration**: Runs on port 5000 with host binding to 0.0.0.0

### Production Considerations
- **Secret Key**: Environment variable configuration for session security
- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels for debugging and monitoring
- **Static Assets**: CDN delivery for external libraries (Bootstrap, CodeMirror, Font Awesome)

### Security Features
- **Code Isolation**: Subprocess execution prevents direct system access
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable secrets
- **Input Validation**: Built-in protection against code injection

### Scalability Design
- **Stateless Architecture**: Each request is independent, enabling horizontal scaling
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight stack for easy deployment
- **Modular Structure**: Problem definitions can be easily extended or modified

The application is designed as a proof-of-concept for an educational coding platform, with a focus on simplicity and extensibility. The architecture supports easy addition of new problems and can be extended with features like user authentication, progress tracking, and multiple programming languages.
